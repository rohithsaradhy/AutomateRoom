This is a project initiated to automate the lights and fan in the hostel room. There are two modes of automating it. First is the voice activated automation and the second is automating it using PiUi. The former is accomplished by the  code given by VoiceCommand.py file. And the, latter using console.py. The piui runs a web application on the apache server which is installed in the raspberry pi. The arduino is programmed to take numbers through serial port  and correpondingly switch
off and on the lights and fan, with the help of relays,  according to the "arduino commands.txt" map.
